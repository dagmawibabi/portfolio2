Dagmawi Babi
Believer, Creative Developer
Hello! My name is Dagmawi and I enjoy creating tech solutions to my daily problems. My
interest in software development started back in 2013 when I accidentally stumbled upon
a batch programming ebook in one of my harddrives â€” turns out there's so much you could
do on a black & white terminal!
Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at multiple start ups, an
event organizing company, a huge corporation, campus clubs and handled government
projects. My main focus these days is building modern, minimal and powerful products and
digital experiences at Dream Intelligence for the world to explore.

Christian Projects
My Bible
My Bible is an aesthetic, minimally designed and feature rich Bible app with 9 major translations. This Bible app is built around the idea that in order to grasp a fuller picture of the meaning of scriptures, multiple versions should be read and studied in parallel. And so it is designed and built in a way that puts the Bible at the center of the user experience with as little distractions as possible, allowing a single click on any verse to show multiple translations instantly.

AASTU ECSF App
I had the privilege of developing the app for my fellowship along with some amazing Christians. So if you want to read incredible spiritual blogs, get daily devotions, set Christian wallpapers, listen to Christian songs, browse our gallery of images from all the teams and even get anonymous counceling about whatever you are going through in life you can check out the app!

Social Projects
Ruthful Hearts
Ruthful Hearts is aiming to change people's lives one person at a time. Using anonymous donations we make meaningful changes on the lives of people in need. We have these core principles: Anonymous Donations, For All Kinds of People, One at a Time and Private and Graceful. We focus on the people being helped instead of focusing on who donated how much and we value a person simply because each human life is valuable. Let's change lives!

API Hub
APIHub is an all-in-one API destination. It is a wrapper around major and popular APIs to have a uniform way of accessing all of them. It's a parent API to all other APIs. I don't have to relearn end-points, dig through their documentations, convert responses to JSON and go through the hassle anymore. It goes further than the basic API usage provided; it handles calculations, date conversions, response limits, data filters, date ranges and so much more.
